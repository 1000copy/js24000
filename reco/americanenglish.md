## Lesson 119 Where's the Toilet?

You're walking along the street.You need to go to the washroom *desperately*.What do you do?If you can't control yourself,you cound be *embarrassed* to no end.

Don't worry.Someone in San Francisco has invented a self-cleaning public toilet.The toilet cleans itself.The seat goes back into the wall where it is washed and blow-dried.Even the floors are washed automatically.You must be quick,though.You've only got 20 minutes to "do you bussiness".Then,there's a 2-minute warning before the door opens.When it does,you'd better be ready or your face will be red!

## Lesson 121 Kick the Habit

There are millions of people all over the world who smoke.Most of these smokers have tried to quit smoking at least once in their lives,but *in vain*.Make no mistake;smoking is *addictive*.And once you are *addicted*,it's very diffcult to stop smoking.Many people have tried many diferent ways to kick the habit.None of them is easy.

Take a tip from me.I smoked for twenty-five years.Then one day,I decided to quit *cold turkey* after trying everything else.It worked.That was two years ago and I haven't smoked a single cigarette since then.Good luck.

cold turkey : in a sudden and abrupt manner.

Lesson 123 Early to Bed,Early to Rise

"Early to bed,Early to rise,"so goes an old saying.But how many of us are in the habit of doing that?Not many,I bet.Most of us need an alarm clock to wake us up.But even that doesn't always work.It's too easy to punch the off button and fall asleep again.

The Lazybones Alarm Clock may be the solution to our problem.It's specially designed so that it cannot be switched off with a simple push of a button.The clock has several "protective shells."You must open these shells one by one before you can turn off the alarm.If you don't,it'll keep on saying,"Good morning...good morning..."So if any of you lazybones need a morning call that really gets you out of bed,this clock might be just the thing for you.

Lesson 125 Partying with Foreigners

Partying is fun.But have you ever been invited to a party by a foreigner?What should you wear?Should you bring anything?if so,what?Don't worry.Today we are going to give yousome tips about partying with foreigners.
First,you should ask if it is a formal or casual party.Then you will know what to wear.It's as simple as that.At a casual party,it is customary to bring a bottle of wine or some other *refreshment*.It is not considered polite to bring someone along with you unless you first ask your host.At more formal parties like birthdays,a small gift will be sufficient.Finally,never overstay your welcome.When it's getting late,it's time to thank your host for a wonderful evening and say good night.

Lesson 127 A Shocking Experience

Taking a taxi in a certain Easten Europe country can be a shocking experience.It is said that some taxi drivers have metal wires stuck into the passenger seats.And when a button is pushed,the seat will give you a electric shock.These taxi drivers don't do this for fun.They do it to tourists who argue about the *ridiculouse fares*  they charge.Some drivers charge as much as ten times the legal fare.They have a secret switch which makes the meters run faster.If you refuse to pay,you are really in for a shock.

In one case,a German woman had no choice but to pay US$120 for a US$20 ride from the airport.She said that she was "really taken for a ride,"but what shound she do?Besides the electric shock,she was *verbally* abused and threatened with physical violence.She has only one piece of advice to tourists:"Take the bus or stay at home."

Lesson 129 Dog Days Off 

Have you ever made an excuse for not going to work?I guess most people have.But have you ever called in for a day off because your dog is sick?I bet you haven't.Most people wouldn't have the *guts*.
However,some companies in New Zealand find this as an acceptable reason for taking a day off.It is counted as paid sick leave.The reason,they say,is simple:"A sick dog is as much as a dependant as a sick child."That makes plenty of sense,doesn't it?This is now known in Zealand as "dog days off."I wonder what the bosses in china will say if someone calls in for a dog off.

Lesson 131 Lost and Found

In recent years,going abroadfor a holiday has almost become a national pastime.Traveling is indeed fun.But those of you traveling for the first time beware!What should you do if you lose your luggage?Don't panic.Just go straight to the airline you're traveling with.They'll direct you to the Lost and Found department.
In most case,they'll find your luggage.But you must not forget one thing when you're at the check-in counter.Make sure you get a baggage check stub.Without it,the airline will have great difficulty helping you.Worried about what to say at the Lost and Found?Well,tune in tomorrow and listen to someone who has just lost his luggage.

Lesson 133 Smile,Everybody!

"When you're smiling,the whole world smiles with you"These are the words taken from an old song.These words must have given Tomiji Kondo a bright idea.He started smiling classes.Now,they're all over Japan.People from *all walks of life*,aged 20 to 83,attend these classes.

As you enter the class,you must shout out "Konbanwa!" as loudly and cheerfully as possible.Then you're supposed to make direct eye contact and smile as you shake hands with your classmates.No bowing is neccessary.Laughing is not allowed,either.According to Kondo,smiling immediately makes you feel better.Sound like a good idea?Why not give it a try?

Lesson 135 The Roaring Englishman

A strange thing happened in London recently.A large number of Englishman started roaring and eating food off the floor.They were behaving like a pack of lions.No,they weren't going bananas.They were normal people like you and me.But they watched a *therapist* on a daytime TV show.They were convined by him that roaring is good for you."Roaring helps people who are uptight to relax,"he said.

The "Therapist" turned out to be a hoaxer.He goes around the world playing tricks on people.It's all for fun.So if you don't want to be feel like a fool,watch out!you can't always believe what you see,read and hear.

Lesson 137 Going to the Barber's

In the old days,going to the barber's was as simple as ABC.You sit down,the barber cuts your hair,you pay,you leave and that's it.Nowadays,the hairstylist will ask you how you would like your hair done.How on earth do I know?I'm no barber.So what do I do?I go to the same guy all the time.As soon as he sees me,he says,"Same as before?"I reply with a smile,"Yes,please."In twenty minutes the job is done.

For those of you who don't know what to say to the barber,just rememberthe two S's - short and simple.When I was aboard,it always worked.Don't forget to give the barber a tip before you leave,though.It's their custom.If you don't,make sure you don't go back or you might get something else cut as well.

Lesson 139 The Dance Cop

Do you want to be a traffic cop in Thailand?Are you a good dancer?If you aren't,you won't stand a chance.

Traffic cops in thailand dance as they direct traffic.These cops are good entertainers.They twist and turn and make fancy movements with their white-gloved hands.Everyone agrees they help ease tension on the roads.And because they make people smile ad feel happy,the image of Bangkok policeman has improved by leaps and bounds.As a result,motorists have become more cooperative and understanding.Odd as it may be,it seems to work.Don't forget to also keep your eye on the road,though.If you don't,you might cause an accident.You can be sure the cops won't be dancing then.

Lesson 141 Men or Monkeys

No matter what anybody says,there's no telling how man came into existence.But some people insist that through evolution human beings come from apes.A recent incident seems to support such a suggestion.

A three-year-old boy fell from a height of 18 feet into an area where gorillas were kept in a zoo.On seeing this,a 150-pound gorilla came to his rescue.To everyone's *astonishment*,it picked up the boy,craddled him in its arms and brought him to the zookeepers.While zoogoers screamed in horror,the gorilla showed *maternal* behavior and even protected the child from other gorillas.The boy survived and the gorillas was given an award.This accident had many people asking,"Could it be that humans do have a special *bond* with apes?"Whatevry the answer may be,there's no denying the *resemblance* between men and monkeys.

Lesson 143 How to improve your writing skills?

By the time you reach this page,you will have studied 142 lessons of this book.You will have learned many new words,idioms,sentence structures and quite a bit of grammar.You will have come to a stage where you might be asking yourself,"How much have I improved,if at all?"

Why not give yourself a simple test?Read a short text.Read it carefully,then try to rewrite what you have just read,in your own words.After that,compare what you have written to the text.This is called paraphrasing.In fact,it is a good way to improve your writing skills.

Lesson 145 Breakfast Improve Mental Sharpness

If you are not in the habit of having breakfast,then you should start doing so.A recent study shows that not only is breakfast the most important meal of the day,but it is also important to eat it at the right time.The timing of breakfast may affect one's performance in school or at work.For instance,if children eat breakfast 30 minutes before school,they will probably do better than those eat it two hours earlier.

What you eat is also an important factor.If you eat sweet foods,they will probably improve your ability to think and remember.In brief,the study claims that they improve mental sharpness.If I were you,I would give it try.After all,what's there to lose?

Lesson 147 Let Experience Be the Teacher

It has often been said that there's no better teacher than experience.So how does a student of English learn the language through experience?Obviously,to experience English,you'll have to use it as often as possible.That is why more and more teachers use role plays,dramas and field trips to teach English.What you see,hear and feel will more likely stick in your mind than what you read in a book.

Should you have the opportunity to take part in a school drama one day,you will probably try to memorize your lines to perfection.If you are anything of an actor,you will probably say your lines with emotion.In other words,you may experience the use of the language as it is really used in everyday life.So if I were you,I would let experience be the teacher.
