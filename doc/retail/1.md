Dependency - I have a not relationship with an object.but it reference.

	public class Foo { 
	    void Baz(Bar bar) {
	    } 
	};

Association - I have a relationship with an object. 

	public class Foo { 
		Bar bar;
	};

Composition - I own an object and I am responsible for its lifetime, when Foo dies, so does Bar

	public class Foo {
	    private Bar bar = new Bar(); 
	}

Aggregation - I have an object which I've borrowed from someone else. When Foo dies, Bar may live on.

	public class Foo { 
	    private Bar bar; 
	    Foo(Bar bar) { 
	       this.bar = bar; 
	    }
	}
